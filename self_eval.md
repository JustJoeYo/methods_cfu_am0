# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
  I am most proud of getting it all done in a timely matter instead of waiting till last minute.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
  The power of using methods in our application is not having to repeat code over and over again for methods that we can just assign over and over again. The do not repeat code method is my favorite by far.
